# hello-world
This is my first GitHub page!

So I'm here following the GitHub 'Hello World' tutorial on how to get started with GitHub. Hopefully, I can master the site quickly and come back to this repo in a few years time and have a good laugh about how far I've gone.

This commit is just for the 'lulz' as I'm trying to see how the site updates commits.
